          additional terms and conditions, "Additional Agreements"). Together<br>
          with this Agreement, such Additional Agreements will govern your use of those<br>

          1.4 Your Account is identified by the email address you provided and you are<br>
          the only party authorized to use your user ID (email address). You are<br>
          responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registered account with<br>
          us and any password(s) you have chosen or we may issue to you in connection<br>
          with your access and use of the Services. You are responsible for all uses of<br>
          your account, whether or not actually or expressly authorized by you. If you<br>
          believe that your account and/or password(s) have been misused or compromised<br>
          in any manner, please contact us immediately at support@Invaluable.com.<br><br>
          <br>
          1.5 Covenant Regarding Your Account. You agree that you will not maintain<br>
          multiple registered accounts with us without our express written consent. If<br>
          you wish to maintain a multiple account, you may submit a request to do so to<br>
          support@Invaluable.com, including your primary User Name and your rationale for<br>
          having multiple accounts.<br><br>
          <br>
          1.6 Equipment. You shall be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining<br>
          all telephone, communications, computer hardware and other equipment needed for<br>
          access to and use of the Services and all charges of any description arising<br>
          from or relating thereto.<br><br>
          <br>
          1.7 Invaluable not involved in auctions/release. We are not involved in actual<br>
          transactions between users of the Sites or any "External Sites" as<br>
          defined in section 5.1 below (whether such users are auction houses,<br>
          appraisers, art or antiques dealers, trade members, curators, educators,<br>
          antiques professionals, collectors or other third parties affiliated with Invaluable).<br>
          We have no control over the quality or legality of the items displayed on our<br>
          Sites or the truth or accuracy of the descriptions of such items, upcoming<br>
          auction events or auction results displayed on our Sites. In the event that you<br>
          have a dispute with any parties arising out of your use of the Sites you hereby<br>
          release Invaluable from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential)<br>
          of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,<br>
          disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such<br>
          disputes. <br><br>
          <br>
          2. Live and Timed Auctions Participation. THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON <br><br>
          WHICH INVALUABLE OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO BID ONLINE AT LIVE AND TIMED AUCTIONS<br>
          CONDUCTED BY PARTICIPATING AUCTION HOUSES AND LICENSED AUCTIONEERS<br>
          ("AHs").<br><br>
          <br>
          2.1 Invaluable only a venue. Notwithstanding section 1.7 above, we are not an<br>
          auction house and are not conducting the live and timed auctions. Our service<br>
          allows you to participate in live and timed auctions conducted by the AHs. We<br>
          are solely a passive conduit to facilitate communication between you and the<br>
          AH. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to change some or all of our<br>
          services at any time. <br><br>
          <br>
          2.1.01 Control. We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the<br>
          items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of AHs to<br>
          sell or the ability of buyers to buy items. We do not ensure that a buyer or<br>
          seller will actually complete a transaction.<br><br>
          <br>
          2.1.02 Release. Notwithstanding section 1.7 above, because we are not involved<br>
          in the actual transaction between buyers and AHs, in the event that you have a<br>
          dispute with an AH, you release Invaluable (and our officers, directors,<br>
          agents, parent, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees) from claims,<br>
          demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known<br>
          and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out<br>
          of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California<br>
          resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A<br>
          general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or<br>
          suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if<br>
          known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the<br>
          debtor." <br><br>
          <br>
          2.2 Eligibility. Each AH that conducts a live or timed auction will have its<br>
          own eligibility requirements that must be met in order for you to participate<br>
          in that auction. You may be required to apply for and obtain approval in order<br>
          to participate in a specific live or timed auction, including in some cases<br>
          providing credit card information if you have not done so previously. You agree<br>
          to maintain at all times the accuracy of your account information including<br>
          contact information, addresses and credit card information, and to allow us to<br>
          provide any of your account information to AHs whenever necessary, including<br>
          for participating in auctions. Approval to participate in one live or timed<br>
          auction does not guarantee approval to participate in any other live or timed<br>
          auction, conducted either by that AH, or another AH. Each AH has sole<br>
          discretion to refuse to approve your eligibility for any live or timed auction.<br>
          <br>
          <br><br>
          2.3 Fees. Each AH may charge a buyer's premium (which is an additional fee that<br>
          a winning bidder is required to pay above the auction price) as well as other<br>
          shipping, handling, and other fees including applicable taxes, if any. AHs may<br>
          facilitate shipping through a third-party, however in all cases, the buyer will<br>
          pay applicable shipping charges unless otherwise noted in the AH terms and<br>
          conditions. These fees are subject to change depending upon the AH and the<br>
          particular item for sale, and are set by the AH. A fee is charged for all<br>
          online purchases using the Service which will be in addition to the AH charges<br>
          unless otherwise noted in the AH terms and conditions. By using the Services,<br>
          you agree to be bound by and pay all fees according to the terms of this<br>
          Agreement and the AH terms and conditions.<br>
          Certain AHs may allow you to pay for items using the online payment service powered by WePay, Inc.  ("WePay") and made available on the Sites (the "Payment Service").  Your use of the Payment Service is solely governed by WePay''s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy located at www.wepay.com/legal (collectively, the "WePay Terms").  You expressly acknowledge and agree that, if you elect to use the Payment Service, neither WePay nor Invaluable is a party to any contract between you and any AH.  All transactions, using the Payment Service or otherwise, remain subject to the applicable AH terms and conditions (including the refund policies posted therein).<br>
          <br>
          You may not use the Payment Service to engage in activities prohibited by the WePay Terms or otherwise to violate applicable law.  Either Invaluable or WePay may decline to process transactions that are too large in dollar amount, too long in duration or exceed other risk parameters.  In addition, WePay may decline to provide the Payment Service to you, or may impose a reserve requirement, or may limit transaction size, or may decline to process a transaction, based on WePay''s then-current compliance and risk management programs or any other bona fide reason. You will indemnify, hold harmless and defend Invaluable, WePay and their respective affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, damages, demands, obligations, proceedings, investigations, liabilities or other losses of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising from a third party claim based on, arising from or relating to your use of the Payment Service.<br>
          <br><br>
          <br>
          2.4.01 Auction Houses. AHs will list items up for auction for you to bid on.<br>
          Auction dates and times, as well as the number, character, and order and<br>
          schedule of the items to be auctioned are set by the AH and are subject to<br>
          change without notice. Individual lots and items may be modified or changed at<br>
          any time. Some lots and items that are made available on the auction floor will<br>
          not be included in the online live auction services. We do not control the<br>
          information that is provided by AH's and which is made available through our system.<br>
          We do not guarantee that the AH's maintain proper auctioneer's licenses or<br>
          comply with all laws.<br>
          <br>
          <br>2.4.02 Based upon the<br>
          information provided by AH, Invaluable may categorize, tag or otherwise<br>
          describe property listed for auction on the Sites.&nbsp; Such categorizations,<br>
          "tags" and descriptions are provided for convenience only.&nbsp;<br>
          <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Invaluable disclaims all representations and<br>
          warranties regarding the accuracy or reliability of such categorizations,<br>
          tags or descriptions of any nature, and by using the site, you hereby<br>
          acknowledge and agree that you shall have no recourse against Invaluable and its<br>
          affilaites and representatives arising out of or related to any such<br>
          categorizations, TAgs or descriptions.</span><br><br>
          <br>
          2.5 Bidding, Buying and Conditions of Sale. You may cancel an absentee bid on a<br>
          lot for a live auction up until the lot has been opened for live bidding. For<br>
          timed auctions the following cancelation rules will apply: <br><br>
          (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) Only three (3) bids may be canceled per session/<span<br>
          class=GramE&gt;catalog<br><br>
          (ii) No bid cancellations will be allowed within 2 hours of the scheduled first<br>
          lot end time.<br><br>
          If either of the two rules above has been exceeded (i.e. 3 timed bids have<br>
          already been cancelled for a single session/catalog or the timed auction is<br>
          within 2 hours), bidders may call Invaluable to request that their bid be<br>
          cancelled. These requests may only be made during office hours. Voicemail<br>
          requests for bid cancellation will not be considered.<br><br>
          <br>
          Invaluable reserves the right to take any adverse action, including without<br>
          limitation, termination of an account, against those who are deemed to be<br>
          abusing bid retraction and cancellations.<br><br>
          You expressly acknowledge and agree that Invaluable makes no guarantee or<br>
          representation regarding the effectiveness or success of bids. By placing a<br>
          bid, you expressly authorize Invaluable to begin bidding and continue bidding<br>
          on your behalf at any price in excess of the opening bid and up to the amount<br>
          of your<br><br>
          bid. You expressly acknowledge that Invaluable owes no duty to you to obtain<br>
          the <br><br>
          lowest possible price on behalf of you. The terms and conditions for<br>
          participation in each auction, <br><br>
          including how bids are accepted, rules governing absentee bids, bid increments,<br>
          bid retraction and cancellation, the conditions the buyer must meet to purchase<br>
          the item, as well as the specific conditions of sale (such as warranties,<br>
          shipping costs, insurance, and the like) may change for each auction by the AH.<br>
          The AH is required to post such terms and conditions and to maintain the terms<br>
          throughout the auction period. You agree to be bound by those bidding terms and<br>
          conditions of sale by agreeing to this Agreement. This Agreement, in addition<br>
          to those AH terms and conditions, govern your bidding activity as well as your<br>
          participation in an auction, except for timed auctions where the acceptance of<br>
          bids is determined solely by Invaluable's technology, the AH acts as an <br><br>
          auctioneer and has the final determination with respect to the bidding on the<br>
          item the sale of the item and the resolution of disputes, including the right<br>
          using its sole discretion to: a) determine who is the successful bidder; b)<br>
          reject any bid that it believes is not commensurate with the value of the item<br>
          being offered; and c) reject any bid that it believes may have a detrimental<br>
          effect on the item in question, or the auction as a whole. <br><br>
          <br>
          2.6 Video and Audio. Any audio or video aspects of a live auction event are for<br>
          entertainment purposes only.<br><br>
          <br>
          2.7 No warranty. WITHOUT LIMITING SECTION 10 BELOW, WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE<br>
          LIVE OR TIMED AUCTION SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT BIDS<br>
          WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE AH OR INFORMATION REGARDING CURRENT PRICE WILL BE<br>

          Section 5. Sites Access; Interference with Services; Monitoring; Compliance<br>
          with Laws.<br><br>
          <br>
          5.1 Sites Access. We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure<br>
          access to the Services, and operation of the Sites may be interfered with by<br>
          numerous factors outside of our control. We recommend that you use Invaluable<br>
          with Microsoft Windows Operating Systems and Internet Explorer Version 5.5 or<br>
          later. Internet connection speed will determine how rapidly pages with<br>
          photographs load to your browser. <br><br>
          <br>
          5.2 No Interference. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, other<br>
          automatic device, or manual process to monitor or copy our web pages or the content<br>
          contained herein without our prior expressed written permission. You agree that<br>
          you will not use any device, software, or routine to interfere or attempt to<br>
          interfere with the proper working of the Sites or the Services, or any<br>
          transaction being conducted on or through the Sites or Services. You agree that<br>
          you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately<br>
          large load on the server infrastructure of the Sites.<br><br>
          <br>
          5.3 Fraudulent Activity. You may not register to use any Services under a false<br>
          name, or use an invalid or unauthorized credit card in connection with any<br>
          Services. You may not make offers to purchase any goods or services under a<br>
          false name while using the Services. You may not impersonate any other user of<br>
          the Services, or make use of another user's password(s). Such fraudulent<br>
          conduct is a violation of federal and state laws. Fraudulent conduct may be<br>
          reported by us to law enforcement authorities, and we will cooperate with such<br>
          authorities to ensure that violators are prosecuted to the fullest extent of<br>
          the law.<br><br>
          <br>
          5.4 Monitoring. You agree that Invaluable has the right, but not the<br>
          obligation, to monitor any form of user activity and/or Content linked to or<br>
          from or otherwise associated with the Services. We may investigate any reported<br>
          violation of our Agreement, Additional Agreements or Sites policies, and any<br>
          user or other third party complaints relating thereto. We may take any action<br>
          that we deem appropriate in connection with any such investigation without notice<br>
          (including without limitation issuing warnings, suspending or terminating<br>
          Services, denying Sites access and/or removing any materials posted on the<br>
          Sites). We may also investigate, in our sole discretion, the use of any credit<br>
          card by a user in connection with the Services, and take such action as we deem<br>
          necessary or appropriate, including without limitation contacting the owner or<br>
          user of such card or canceling purchase orders placed by such owner or user.<br><br>
          <br>
          5.5 Compliance with Laws. The Services may be used only for lawful purposes and<br>
          in a lawful manner. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, statutes and<br>
          regulations regarding use of the Services and any transactions that may be<br>
          conducted by means of the Services.<br><br>

          This Agreement does not apply to your use of any External Sites to which the<br>
          Sites links, and we are not responsible for the availability of any External<br>
          Sites to which the Sites links. We do not endorse or take responsibility for<br>

          the availability of, or the content, advertising, products, or other materials<br>
          located on or through, any External Sites. Under no circumstances will we be<br>
          held responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage that<br>
          is caused or alleged to have been caused to you in connection with your use of,<br>
          or reliance on, any content, goods, or services available on any External<br>
          Sites. If you decide to access an External Sites, you do so at your own risk. You<br>
          should contact the sites administrator or Webmaster for those External Sites if<br>
          you have any concerns regarding such links or the content or services located<br>
          on such External Sites.<br><br>
          <br>
          Section 7. Breach.<br><br>
          <br>
          7.1 Without limiting other remedies, we may immediately issue a warning,<br>
          temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your registered user<br>
          account and/or refuse to provide the Services to you: (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<br>
          if you breach this Agreement or any of the Additional Agreements it<br>
          incorporates by reference or which you have separately entered into with Invaluable;<br>
          (ii) if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to<br>
          us; or (iii) if we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you,<br>
          us, our other users, or other third party business affiliates.<br><br>
          <br>
          Section 8. Indemnity.<br><br>
          <br>
          8.1 You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Invaluable and its affiliates, and<br>
          their respective officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers,<br>
          and licensors (collectively, the "Company Parties") harmless from and<br>
          against any and all claims, liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including<br>
          attorneys' fees) incurred by any Company Party in connection with any use or<br>
          alleged use of the Service under your password by any person, whether or not<br>
          authorized by you. Invaluable reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume<br>
          the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to<br>
          indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with <span<br>
          class=SpellE&gt;Invaluable's defense of such claim.<br><br>
          <br>
          Section 9. Termination of or Change in the Services.<br><br>
          <br>

          reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate<br>
          your access to all or any part of the Services at any time for any reason<br>
          without prior notice or liability. Invaluable may change, suspend or<br>
          discontinue all or any aspect of the Services at any time, including the<br>
          availability of any feature, database, or Content without prior notice or<br>
          liability.<br><br>
          <br>
          SECTION 10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.<br><br>
          <br>
          10.1 NEITHER INVALUABLE NOR ANY PROVIDER OF THIRD PARTY CONTENT OR THEIR<br>
          RESPECTIVE AGENTS WARRANTS THAT THE SITES OR SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR<br>
          REQUIREMENTS OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR FREE; NOR DOES INVALUABLE,<br>
          ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDER, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS MAKE ANY WARRANTY<br>
          AS TO THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SITES, SERVICES OR THE<br>
          CONTENT. THE SERVICES AND THE CONTENT ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS, AS<br>
          AVAILABLE" BASIS. NONE OF INVALUABLE, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS, AND<br>
          THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS,<br>
          IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR<br>
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR<br>
          NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE SITES, SERVICES, ANY CONTENT OR ANY<br>
          PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD THROUGH THE SERVICES. NEITHER INVALUABLE NOR ANY<br>
          THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDER WARRANTS THAT ANY FILES AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING<br>
          THROUGH THE SITES OR SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR SIMILAR CONTAMINATION<br>
          OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br>
          QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE<br>
          CONTENT IS ASSUMED SOLELY BY YOU. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY PROVISION HEREIN, INVALUABLE<br>
          MAKES NO WARRRANY THAT ANY PARTICULAR COMPUTER SYSTEM CONFIGURATION WILL BE<br>
          COMPATIBLE WITH THE SITES. IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR<br>
          COMPUTER SYSTEM HAS THE RECOMMENDED HARDWARE, OPERATING SOFTWARE, AND INTERNET<br>
          BROWSER SOFTWARE VERSIONS TO ACHIEVE THE SITES FULL FUNCTIONALITY AND<br>
          CAPABILITIES. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or<br>
          limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above disclaimer or<br>
          limitation may not apply to you. You may have other rights, which vary from<br>
          state to state.<br><br>
          <br>
          10.2 The Sites includes an extensive collection of auction records that might<br>
          be used as tools in the process of estimating values. Invaluable Content is<br>
          only one of several elements that you should consider in estimating value of an<br>
          antique or other artistic work and depends upon the accuracy and timing of<br>
          information which Invaluable itself receives. Invaluable strongly recommends<br>
          that its Content only be used in conjunction with other specialists such as<br>
          Auction Houses, Personal Property Appraisers, Museums, and Dealers.<br><br>
          While Invaluable will endeavor to use commercially reasonable efforts to confirm the authenticity of the goods it receives and posts for auction via its websites, Invaluable makes no claims, representations or warranties with regard to the authenticity of any goods sold on its websites.  Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.  In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Invaluable (including our affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) is not liable, and you agree not to hold Invaluable responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from the items posted for sale on our websites.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.  If you have purchased an item that is not as described in our posting for auction, your sole remedy is to return it in the condition you received it in exchange for a refund.<br><br>
          If you believe that an item posted for sale on our websites violates a trademark, copyright or other intellectual property right held by you, please notify us immediately regarding the posting in question and the basis for your claim so we can properly investigate your claim.<br><br>
          <br>
          10.3 Invaluable and third party content providers are not responsible for the<br>
          translations provided by Google Translate. The translated copies of the Sites<br>
