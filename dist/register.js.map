You are responsible for all uses of<br>\n          your account, whether or not actually or expressly authorized by you.

You shall be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining<br>\n          all telephone, communications, computer hardware and other equipment needed for<br>\n          access to and use of the Services and all charges of any description arising<br>\n          from or relating thereto.<br><br>\n          <br>\n          1.7 Invaluable not involved in auctions/release. We are not involved in actual<br>\n          transactions between users of the Sites or any \"External Sites\" as<br>\n          defined in section 5.1 below (whether such users are auction houses,<br>\n          appraisers, art or antiques dealers, trade members, curators, educators,<br>\n          antiques professionals, collectors or other third parties affiliated with Invaluable).<br>\n          We have no control over the quality or legality of the items displayed on our<br>\n          Sites or the truth or accuracy of the descriptions of such items, upcoming<br>\n          auction events or auction results displayed on our Sites. In the event that you<br>\n          have a dispute with any parties arising out of your use of the Sites you hereby<br>\n          release Invaluable from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential)<br>\n          of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,<br>\n          disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such<br>\n          disputes. <br><br>\n          <br>\n          2. Live and Timed Auctions Participation. THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON <br><br>\n          WHICH INVALUABLE OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO BID ONLINE AT LIVE AND TIMED AUCTIONS<br>\n          CONDUCTED BY PARTICIPATING AUCTION HOUSES AND LICENSED AUCTIONEERS<br>\n          (\"AHs\").<br><br>\n          <br>\n          2.1 Invaluable only a venue. Notwithstanding section 1.7 above, we are not an<br>\n          auction house and are not conducting the live and timed auctions. Our service<br>\n          allows you to participate in live and timed auctions conducted by the AHs. We<br>\n          are solely a passive conduit to facilitate communication between you and the<br>\n          AH. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to change some or all of our<br>\n          services at any time. <br><br>\n          <br>\n          2.1.01 Control. We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the<br>\n          items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of AHs to<br>\n          sell or the ability of buyers to buy items. We do not ensure that a buyer or<br>\n          seller will actually complete a transaction.<br><br>\n          <br>\n          2.1.02 Release. Notwithstanding section 1.7 above, because we are not involved<br>\n          in the actual transaction between buyers and AHs, in the event that you have a<br>\n          dispute with an AH, you release Invaluable (and our officers, directors,<br>\n          agents, parent, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and employees) from claims,<br>\n          demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known<br>\n          and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out<br>\n          of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California<br>\n          resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A<br>\n          general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or<br>\n          suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if<br>\n          known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the<br>\n          debtor.\" <br><br>\n          <br>\n          2.2 Eligibility. Each AH that conducts a live or timed auction will have its<br>\n          own eligibility requirements that must be met in order for you to participate<br>\n          in that auction. You may be required to apply for and obtain approval in order<br>\n          to participate in a specific live or timed auction, including in some cases<br>\n          providing credit card information if you have not done so previously. You agree<br>\n          to maintain at all times the accuracy of your account information including<br>\n          contact information, addresses and credit card information, and to allow us to<br>\n          provide any of your account information to AHs whenever necessary, including<br>\n          for participating in auctions. Approval to participate in one live or timed<br>\n          auction does not guarantee approval to participate in any other live or timed<br>\n          auction, conducted either by that AH, or another AH. Each AH has sole<br>\n          discretion to refuse to approve your eligibility for any live or timed auction.<br>\n          <br>\n          <br><br>\n          2.3 Fees. Each AH may charge a buyer's premium (which is an additional fee that<br>\n          a winning bidder is required to pay above the auction price) as well as other<br>\n          shipping, handling, and other fees including applicable taxes, if any. AHs may<br>\n          facilitate shipping through a third-party, however in all cases, the buyer will<br>\n          pay applicable shipping charges unless otherwise noted in the AH terms and<br>\n          conditions. These fees are subject to change depending upon the AH and the<br>\n          particular item for sale, and are set by the AH. A fee is charged for all<br>\n          online purchases using the Service which will be in addition to the AH charges<br>\n          unless otherwise noted in the AH terms and conditions. By using the Services,<br>\n          you agree to be bound by and pay all fees according to the terms of this<br>\n          Agreement and the AH terms and conditions.<br>\n          Certain AHs may allow you to pay for items using the online payment service powered by WePay, Inc.  (\"WePay\") and made available on the Sites (the \"Payment Service\").  Your use of the Payment Service is solely governed by WePay''s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy located at www.wepay.com/legal (collectively, the \"WePay Terms\").  You expressly acknowledge and agree that, if you elect to use the Payment Service, neither WePay nor Invaluable is a party to any contract between you and any AH.  All transactions, using the Payment Service or otherwise, remain subject to the applicable AH terms and conditions (including the refund policies posted therein).<br>\n          <br>\n          You may not use the Payment Service to engage in activities prohibited by the WePay Terms or otherwise to violate applicable law.  Either Invaluable or WePay may decline to process transactions that are too large in dollar amount, too long in duration or exceed other risk parameters.  In addition, WePay may decline to provide the Payment Service to you, or may impose a reserve requirement, or may limit transaction size, or may decline to process a transaction, based on WePay''s then-current compliance and risk management programs or any other bona fide reason. You will indemnify, hold harmless and defend Invaluable, WePay and their respective affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, damages, demands, obligations, proceedings, investigations, liabilities or other losses of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising from a third party claim based on, arising from or relating to your use of the Payment Service.<br>\n          <br><br>\n          <br>\n          2.4.01 Auction Houses. AHs will list items up for auction for you to bid on.<br>\n          Auction dates and times, as well as the number, character, and order and<br>\n          schedule of the items to be auctioned are set by the AH and are subject to<br>\n          change without notice. Individual lots and items may be modified or changed at<br>\n          any time. Some lots and items that are made available on the auction floor will<br>\n          not be included in the online live auction services.

Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or<br>\n          limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above disclaimer or<br>\n          limitation may not apply to you. You may have other rights, which vary from<br>\n          state to state.<br><br>\n          <br>\n          10.2 The Sites includes an extensive collection of auction records that might<br>\n          be used as tools in the process of estimating values. Invaluable Content is<br>\n          only one of several elements that you should consider in estimating value of an<br>\n          antique or other artistic work and depends upon the accuracy and timing of<br>\n          information which Invaluable itself receives. Invaluable strongly recommends<br>\n          that its Content only be used in conjunction with other specialists such as<br>\n          Auction Houses, Personal Property Appraisers, Museums, and Dealers.<br><br>\n          While Invaluable will endeavor to use commercially reasonable efforts to confirm the authenticity of the goods it receives and posts for auction via its websites, Invaluable makes no claims, representations or warranties with regard to the authenticity of any goods sold on its websites.  Accordingly, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.  In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Invaluable (including our affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) is not liable, and you agree not to hold Invaluable responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from the items posted for sale on our websites.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.  If you have purchased an item that is not as described in our posting for auction, your sole remedy is to return it in the condition you received it in exchange for a refund.<br><br>\n          If you believe that an item posted for sale on our websites violates a trademark, copyright or other intellectual property right held by you, please notify us immediately regarding the posting in question and the basis for your claim so we can properly investigate your claim.<br><br>\n          <br>\n          10.3 Invaluable and third party content providers are not responsible for the<br>\n          translations provided by Google Translate.

Some states do not allow exclusion of implied<br>\n          warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,<br>\n          so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such states,<br>\n          the liability of Invaluable, third party content providers and their respective<br>\n          agents shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. Some states do<br>\n          not allow the limitation of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not<br>\n          apply to you.<br><br>\n          <br>\n          SECTION 12.
